PLEASE NOTE
-----------

* Some packages outside the L4T BSP can only be downloaded
  with an NVIDIA Developer Network login - in particular,
  the CUDA host-side tools.

  To use any packages that require a Devnet login, you must
  create a Devnet account and download the JetPack packages
  you need for your builds using NVIDIA SDK Manager.

  You must then set the variable NVIDIA_DEVNET_MIRROR to
  "file://path/to/the/downloads" in your build configuration
  (e.g., local.conf) to make them available to your bitbake
  builds.  This can be the NVIDIA SDK Manager downloads
  directory, `/home/$USER/Downloads/nvidia/sdkm_downloads`

* The SDK Manager downloads a different package of CUDA host-side
  tools depending on whether you are running Ubuntu 16.04
  or 18.04. If you downloaded the Ubuntu 16.04 package, you
  should add

      CUDA_BINARIES = "cuda-binaries-ubuntu1604"

  to your build configuration so the CUDA recipes can find
  them. Otherwise, the recipes will default to looking for
  the Ubuntu 18.04 package.

* CUDA 10.2 supports up through gcc 8 only. Pre-built binaries
  in the BSP appear to be compatible with gcc 7 and 8 **only**.
  So use only gcc 7 or gcc 8 if you intend to use CUDA.
  Recipes for gcc 8 have been imported from the OE-Core warrior branch
  (the last version of OE-Core to supply gcc 8) to make it easier
  to use this older toolchain.

  See [this wiki page](https://github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra/wiki/Using-gcc8-from-the-contrib-layer)
  for information on adding the `meta-tegra/contrib` layer to your
  builds and configuring them for GCC 8.
