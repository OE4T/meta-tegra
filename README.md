branch: master
LAYERSERIES_COMPAT: gatesgarth


PLEASE NOTE
-----------

* Machine names for NVIDIA development kits have changed
  to align with the new naming in L4T R32.5.0.

* CUDA 10.2 supports up through gcc 8 only. Pre-built binaries
  in the BSP appear to be compatible with gcc 7 and 8 **only**.
  So use only gcc 7 or gcc 8 if you intend to use CUDA.
  Recipes for gcc 8 have been imported from the OE-Core warrior branch
  (the last version of OE-Core to supply gcc 8) to make it easier
  to use this older toolchain.

  See [this wiki page](https://github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra/wiki/Using-gcc8-from-the-contrib-layer)
  for information on adding the `meta-tegra/contrib` layer to your
  builds and configuring them for GCC 8.


Getting Help
-----------

For general build issues or questions about getting started with your build
setup please use the
[Discussions](https://github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra/discussions) tab of the
meta-tegra repository:

* Use the Ideas category for anything you'd like to see included in meta-tegra,
Wiki content, or the
[tegra-demo-distro](https://github.com/OE4T/tegra-demo-distro/issues).
* Use the Q&A category for questions about how to build or modify your Tegra
target based on the content here.
* Use the "Show and Tell" category for any projects you'd like to share which
are related to meta-tegra.
* Use the General channel for anything that doesn't fit well into the categories
above, and which doesn't relate to a build or runtime issue with Tegra yocto
builds.


Reporting Issues
-----------

Use the [Issues tab in meta-tegra](https://github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra/issues)
for reporting build or runtime issues with Tegra yocto build targets.  When
reporting build or runtime issues, please include as much information about your
environment as you can. For example, the target hardware you are building for,
branch/version information, etc.  Please fill in the provided bug template when
reporting issues.
