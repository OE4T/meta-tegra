branch: master
LAYERSERIES_COMPAT: honister


CUDA toolchain compatibility note
---------------------------------

CUDA 10.2 supports up through gcc 8 only, so recipes are included
for adding the gcc 8 toolchain to the build for CUDA use, and `cuda.bbclass`
has been updated to pass the g++ 8 compiler to nvcc for CUDA code compilation.
This is different from earlier releases/branches, which required setting
the toolchain used for all builds to a CUDA-compatible version.


Getting Help
------------

For general build issues or questions about getting started with your build
setup please use the
[Discussions](https://github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra/discussions) tab of the
meta-tegra repository:

* Use the Ideas category for anything you'd like to see included in meta-tegra,
Wiki content, or the
[tegra-demo-distro](https://github.com/OE4T/tegra-demo-distro/issues).
* Use the Q&A category for questions about how to build or modify your Tegra
target based on the content here.
* Use the "Show and Tell" category for any projects you'd like to share which
are related to meta-tegra.
* Use the General channel for anything that doesn't fit well into the categories
above, and which doesn't relate to a build or runtime issue with Tegra yocto
builds.

Reporting Issues
----------------

Use the [Issues tab in meta-tegra](https://github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra/issues)
for reporting build or runtime issues with Tegra yocto build targets.  When
reporting build or runtime issues, please include as much information about your
environment as you can. For example, the target hardware you are building for,
branch/version information, etc.  Please fill in the provided bug template when
reporting issues.

We are required to provide an e-mail address, but please use GitHub as
