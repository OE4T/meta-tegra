Subject: [PATCH 2/5] work around visibility issue

gn commit 46b572ce4ceedfe57f4f84051bd7da624c98bf01 "fixed" the
visibility field not applying to public configs.  This caused dtc to
have issues due to libfdt and others not being specified.  Due to the
number, it was cleaner to remove the visibility field (which defaults to
everything being visible).
