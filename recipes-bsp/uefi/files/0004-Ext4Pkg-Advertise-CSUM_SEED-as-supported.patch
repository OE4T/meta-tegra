Subject: [PATCH] Ext4Pkg: Advertise CSUM_SEED as supported
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We had added support for CSUM_SEED but accidentally forgot to advertise
it in gSupportedIncompatFeat. This made it (erroneously) impossible to
mount CSUM_SEED filesystems.

Detected by attempting to mount a relatively new mkfs.ext4'd filesystem.
