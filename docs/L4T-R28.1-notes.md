As of 30 Jul 2017, the `pyro-l4t-r28.1` branch supports Jetson TX1 and Jetson TX2 builds using L4T R28.1.

Only minimal testing has been performed so far, but core-image-sato images build, and most functionality tested appears to work OK.

Note that with R28.1, the Jetson TX1 boot sequence has been changed to include **cboot** in the chain of bootloaders, similar to the Jetson TX2.  **cboot** loads U-Boot from the LNX partition in the eMMC.
