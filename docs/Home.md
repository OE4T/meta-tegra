Welcome! Here you'll find some useful pages and notes on using the meta-tegra layer in your project. See the linked pages to have a look around!  You may want to start with [this page](Which-branch-should-I-use.md) for information on which branches support which platforms and L4T releases.

If you are a new to the platform and don't have a specific set of layers you plan to use with meta-tegra, or if you are just interested in trying meta-tegra for the first time as quickly as possible, we highly recommend checking out [tegra-demo-distro](https://github.com/OE4T/tegra-demo-distro) as a starting point.  See the README there for instructions to build one of several demo images which demonstrate the capabilities of meta-tegra and companion layers.
