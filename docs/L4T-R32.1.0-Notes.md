As of 13 Apr 2019, the `master` and `warrior` branches support L4T R32.1.0/JetPack 4.2 content for Jetson TX1, Jetson TX2, Jetson Nano, and Jetson AGX Xavier.

## Please Note
The JetPack 4.2 content cannot be downloaded anonymously from NVIDIA's servers. You **must** use NVIDIA SDK Manager to download the JetPack 4.2 Debian packages to your build host, then add this setting to your build configuration (e.g., in `conf/local.conf` under your build directory):
```
NVIDIA_DEVNET_MIRROR = "file://path/to/downloads"
```
By default, the SDK Manager downloads to a directory called `Downloads/nvidia/sdkm_downloads` under your `$HOME` directory, so use that path in the above setting.

The L4T BSP files (driver package, sources for gstreamer plugins, etc.) are accessible without a DevNet account, so if your builds only require the BSP, you don't have to go through these extra steps.

## Jetson TX1 Notes
NVIDIA **does not** support Jetson TX1 with L4T R32.1.0, but it does appear to work with this version of the BSP.  For production use of Jetson TX1, you should stick with L4T R28.x BSP releases.
