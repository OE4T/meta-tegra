Subject: [PATCH] gbm-display: handle kms display-only devices in FindGbmDevice

A display device can be different than its renderer, such as the
case of a kms display-only device. Yet, eglGbmGetPlatformDisplay
needs to initialize its internal GbmDisplay structure and if they
aren't strongly associated (as determined by eglQueryDevices) then
display initialization will fail.

Handle this by providing a fallback to use the first renderer
returned by eglQueryDevices in the case where the display device
in question can't render on its own or isn't being returned by
the egl implementation for any other reason.

Upstream-Status: Pending
