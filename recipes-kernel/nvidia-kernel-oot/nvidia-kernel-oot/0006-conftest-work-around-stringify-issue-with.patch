Subject: [PATCH 6/6] conftest: work around stringify issue with 
 __assign_str_has_no_src_arg test

The kernel trace headers using preprocessor stringification on the
TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH and TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE macros to form the path
name for the header.

gcc pre-defines a macro called linux 'linux' as '1'.

The conftest script uses ${PWD} in its definition of TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH
as part of its __assign_str_has_no_src_arg test. So if your current
working directory happens to have 'linux' in it, as ours typically do
for Yocto builds (e.g., the <machine>-<distro>-linux directory under
tmp/work), the path will get corrupted (e.g., "<machine>-<distro>-1"),
so the test always fails.

This causes OOT builds to fail for kernel 6.10+, since 6.10 introduced
the change to the __assign_str macro that conftest is looking for.

Work around this by un-defining 'linux' in the source for that
particular test.
