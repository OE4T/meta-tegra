Contributed recipes for meta-tegra
==================================

This layer contains recipes to support builds with
meta-tegra that are not directly part of the BSP.

The main use of this layer is to provide an older
gcc toolchain that is compatible with the version
of the CUDA toolkit for the Jetson platforms.

For more information, see
[this wiki page](https://github.com/madisongh/meta-tegra/wiki/Using-gcc8-from-the-contrib-layer).
